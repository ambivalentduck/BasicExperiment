1. Does rhumb line reset?
2. Does it reset due to accumulated error?
3. 



Ways to induce error:
1. Difficult force field (curl)
2. Applied force (smack)
3. Sensorimotor discrepancy

Then we apply probe forces (sweep in time) to check for reset in:
1. Time post disturbance
2. Accumulated error (in each sensory modality)
3. Amount of sensory discrepancy 

Read Bhushane+Shadmehr
Read Bizzi -> deafferented monkeys go back to position/velocity profile pre-(toward target) disturbance.
